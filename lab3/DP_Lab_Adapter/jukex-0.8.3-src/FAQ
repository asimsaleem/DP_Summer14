                      JukeX - Frequently Asked Questions

Q. I have a question for the FAQ. How can I submit it?
A. Please send it to the user/developer mailing list provided at sourceforge.net
   which you will find on the JukeX project summary page:

   http://sourceforge.net/projects/jukex

Q. I do not seem to be able to get JukeX to connect to MySQL. Why is this?
A. MySQL configuration is fairly complex for the beginner and can, at times, be
   challenging even for experienced users. A few hints:
   * Create a user for the Jukex System using the GRANT statement. Documentation
     for the GRANT sytax may be found at http://www.mysql.com. In the most
     simple case (i.e. you want to get it to work and you are not too worried
     about security) something like:
     
     GRANT ALL PERMISSIONS ON JukeX.* TO JukeXUser [IDENTIFIED BY jxpassword]
     
     should work fine. This assumes a database names JukeX and that you wish to
     create a user called JukeXUser [with password set to "jxpassword".
   * Check the JDBC database URL. This is set up during the build process and
     should look like:

     jdbc:mysql://mysqlservername.mydomain.com/DatabaseName

Q. What is the "Icecast/Shoutcast server source connection port"?
A. This is the port that the Icecast/Shoutcast server listens for source
   connections on. JukeX connects on this port to stream music files. The
   port number is one higher than the PortBase set in the Icecast/Shoutcast
   server configuration and defaults to 8001.

Q. What is the "Icecast/Shoutcast server listener connection port"?
A. This is the port that applications connect to the Icecast/Shoutcast server
   on to "listen" to the broadcast. It is also the port on which sources
   such as JukeX must connect to send track information. The port number is
   the PortBase set in the Icecast/Shoutcast server configuration and defaults
   to 8000.

Q. What should I set the "Maximum database connections supported" value to?
A. This sets a hard limit on the number of actual database connections that
   JukeX makes to the database. This will be far lower than the number of
   simultaneous clients that can be supported as JukeX makes use of connection
   pooling. You should not need to change this value from the default of 20, but
   if your JukeX installation is reporting errors under heavy load you may wish
   to increase it.

Q. Tomcat startup is failing with the following message:
   "System property not specified: com.neoworks.connectionpool.properties
   Unable to find any configuration data for database PoolManager.  Exiting."
   Why is this?
A. The application is trying to load a resource from within its own WAR file.
   Tomcat versions prior to 3.3 require an extra line to be added to the
   server.xml file (in the $TOMCAT_HOME/conf directory) to allow this behaviour:
   
   <RequestInterceptor className="org.apache.tomcat.request.Jdk12Interceptor" />
   
   It is the default behaviour for version 3.3 and upwards.

Q. I think that I have found a bug in jukeX. How can I report it?
A. Please use the bug tracking system on sourceforge.net, you will find this on
   the JukeX project summary page:
